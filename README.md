ðŸ§® Calculator â€“ Day 2 | Zero to Hero Coding
Description:

On Day 2 of my Zero to Hero Coding journey, I built a fully functional basic calculator using HTML, Bootstrap 5, and Vanilla JavaScript.
The goal was to focus on DOM manipulation, responsive UI layout, and capturing user input to simulate real calculator behavior.

This project helped strengthen my understanding of how to dynamically update the DOM and handle input events cleanly and efficiently.

âœ¨ Features:
Number and operator button inputs (+, -, *, /)
Real-time input display
Submit button to evaluate expressions
Error handling for invalid inputs
Responsive layout using Bootstrap grid

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
HTML5
Bootstrap 5
JavaScript (Vanilla / ES6)

ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned:
Selecting and listening to multiple DOM elements using querySelectorAll
Appending values to an input field dynamically
Evaluating string-based math expressions with eval() (with caution)
Designing a clean, centered layout using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system
Event handling using addEventListener()
